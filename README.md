The coefficient diagram method (CDM) is a new control design technique. In this
approach, we need to calculate algebraic equations associated with Diophantine
equation and draw polynomial coefficient curves on the coefficient diagram. As a
computer aided design tool, the CDM toolbox (CDMTOOL) presented here enclose
a set of Matlabr routines. The Matlab toolbox is in the public domain and can be
downloaded from this repository
